# nuclear F-actin
Nuclear F-actin is an ImageJ plugin that implements a deep learning–based workflow for the quantitative analysis of nuclear F-actin in cells. The plugin follows a pipeline of cell detection and segmentation of specific intracellular components, designed to enable quantitative analysis of target features. Users can manually annotate the results, and these annotations can be used to support further model retraining.
